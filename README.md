# Advent of Code Solutions

## About

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code, an annual programming challenge that takes place every December. Each day from December 1st to December 25th features a unique two-part programming puzzle that can be solved using any programming language.

Each day's solution is contained in its own folder, including the sample data for that day.

## Solutions Explained

### Day 1

#### [Part 1](Day%201/question1.md)
- I was required to find the total distance between two lists of numbers.
- I sorted both lists and then iterated through both lists at the same time, subtracting the values at each index and adding the difference to a sum.

#### [Part 2](Day%201/question2.md)
- For part 2, I iterated through each value in the first list and counted how many times it appeared in the second list. I then multiplied the value by its count and added the result to a sum.
